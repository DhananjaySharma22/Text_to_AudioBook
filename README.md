## Project Overview üéß
This is a fun and simple machine learning project that converts text into an audiobook using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. The model takes in text input, processes it using NLP techniques, and generates a clear, human-like audio output. This project is great for those who enjoy experimenting with AI-powered voice synthesis.

## Features
- Converts any text into speech
- Supports multiple voices and accents
- Adjustable speech rate for better listening experience
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Technologies Used
- **Python** üêç
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** for speech generation
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** for text preprocessing
- **IPython Display** for playing audio within notebooks

## How to Use
1. Open the project in Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies if needed (`pip install gtts nltk`).
3. Input the text you want to convert.
4. Run the script to generate and play the audiobook.

## Future Improvements
- Adding deep learning-based voice synthesis for more natural speech.
- Implementing real-time text-to-speech conversion.
- Supporting multiple languages for a wider audience.

This project is a great way to explore text-to-speech AI in a simple and practical way. Have fun experimenting! üéôÔ∏è
